# KeepTheStyle Feature Matrix

This matrix tracks the professional-builder roadmap against the current browser-only application. `Available` means the feature is usable now, `Partial` means a useful foundation exists, and `Planned` means it requires further product work. Backend-dependent features are identified separately so the editor does not expose controls that cannot work.

## Requires backend architecture

These features need authenticated storage, databases, queues, secure server-side secrets, or multi-user synchronization. They should be built as a separate hosted platform layer rather than simulated in the static editor:

- CMS collections, dynamic records, drafts, scheduled publishing and server search
- User authentication, roles, permissions and private content
- Real-time collaboration, activity logs and durable cloud version history
- Email notifications, spam protection and secure form processing
- Database integrations, secret API connections, workflows and real-time data
- CDN delivery, server redirects, analytics aggregation and white-label account management

## Quality rule

New controls must produce working preview and exported behavior, persist through `.ktstyle` save/load, respect accessibility preferences, and pass JavaScript syntax checks plus `git diff --check` before release.
